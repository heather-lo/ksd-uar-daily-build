This code can be used to interact with our build packages in S3. 

For local testing, you will need to set up environment variables that you can then source in the terminal. Required variables are AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, 
AWS_REGION, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Make sure to have the required gems before you run ruby deploy_daily_build.rb, too.
